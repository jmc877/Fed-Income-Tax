        <strong>Federal Income Tax: Overview</strong>  
     </div>
    <br>

    <h3>Introduction and Learning Outcomes</h3>
    <p>Welcome to Federal Income Tax! The goal of this course is to acquaint you
        with the fundamental principles of U.S. federal income taxation. 
    </p>
      <br>
    <p>
      The class focuses on understanding the basic U.S. tax regime applicable to individuals.  In particular, we will cover and by the end of the course you should have a basic understanding of the following topics:

        <ul>
          
          <li>Understand the Schanz-Haig-Simons definition of income and identify the core provisions in the Internal Revenue Code that implement this structure, as well as   provisions (so-called tax expenditures) that deviate from it</li>

          <li>Identify and apply common tax policy tools, including horizontal and vertical equity, the ability-to-pay fairness norm (and the standard-of-living norm in competition with it), the neutrality economic norm, and common deviations from the neutrality norm in the name of combatting negative externalities or rent-seeking behavior (or in the form of tax expenditures)</li>

          <li>Analyze the § 61(a)(1) gross income inclusion for compensation for services rendered (including deferral of compensation subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture under § 83) and the statutory exclusions for compensation that we cover, including §§ 132 and 119</li>

          <li>Analyze the scope, content, and interpretation approaches (by both the IRS and courts) of the vague residual (or catchall) clause in § 61—“gross income means all income from whatever source derived”—under Glenshaw Glass and related authorities, including the treatment of windfalls, bargain purchases, rebates, and tenant improvements</li>

          <li>Analyze the taxation of inter vivos and death-time gifts and bequests (and life insurance proceeds) under §§ 101, 102, 1015, and 1014</li>

          <li>Analyze statutory and common law defenses against the assignment of income from one taxpayer to another in both the intact and fractured families, including the transfer of cash and property in a divorce under § 1041</li>

          <li>Understand the income tax consequences of borrowing and lending and identify what receipts can properly be analyzed under the “borrowing exclusion”</li>

          <li>Analyze bad-debt deductions (or worthless securities deductions) taken by lenders or security owners under §§ 165(g) and 166</li> 

          <li>Analyze § 61(a)(12) debt-discharge income for borrowers and relevant statutory exclusions under § 108</li> 

          <li>Analyze the tax consequences of purchasing property with borrowed money and transferring property subject to indebtedness (both recourse and nonrecourse) under Crane, Tufts, and related statutory provisions</li> 

          <li>Calculate realized gain and loss under § 1001, apply certain nonrecognition rules that may allow realized gains to go unrecognized (or may prevent realized and otherwise deductible losses from being recognized), and analyze the basis rules that apply in these instances under §§ 1012, 1033, 1031, and 267</li> 

          <li>Analyze how depreciation and related provisions apply to certain business and investment property under §§ 179, 168, 280F, and 197</li> 

          <li>Analyze the income tax consequences of “net capital gain” under § 1222(11), the capital loss limitation and carryover rules under §§ 1211(b) and 1212(b), depreciation recapture under §§ 1245 and 1250, and the “quasi-capital gain” rules of § 1231</li> 

          <li>Understand the basic concept of a “tax shelter” and how the statutory rules (including §§ 456, 469, 461(l), and 163(d)) combat them</li>

          <li>Analyze the tax consequences of both human capital acquisition costs in the form of education and human capital losses (and compensation for those losses, if obtained) are analyzed under §§ 117, 127, 25A, Treas. Reg. § 1.162-5, and § 104</li>

          <li>Analyze both gambling losses and so-called hobby losses under §§ 165(d) and 183</li>

          <li>Analyze the tax expenditures pertaining to home ownership under §§ 163(h)(3), 121, and 164(a)(1), the likely economic effect of these tax expenditures, and possible reform  proposals</li>

          <li>Analyze the basic rules pertaining to charitable contributions under § 170</li>

        </ul>

    </p>
      <br>
    
      <p>The knowledge gained in this class is extremely valuable in life, and I hope that it inspires your to take additional tax classes, such as a partnership tax, corporate tax, international tax, and issue in tax policy.   </p> 
    <br>  
      <p>If you have not taken a basic financial accounting course, I highly recommend that you try to take one somewhere, somehow before graduation. One option is next door in the business school--the course is 2 credits and is graded on a pass/fail basis. Like finance, accounting is part of the basic grammar of business discourse, and a little knowledge goes a long way. <a href="Accounting_BSchool.docx">Here are some comments</a> by former students on the class and a list of other business school courses that you can take for credit. Here is a good online Wharton course: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-accounting#syllabus">Wharton Accounting</a>. There are also free accounting courses on LinkedIn Learning, which you can access through my.fordham.edu.  These look decent:  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/financial-accounting-part-1/the-importance-of-accounting?u=80268241">

    <h3>Class Textbook </h3>

        <p>The book we'll use this semester is Geier, U.S. Federal Income Taxation of Individuals.  The book is free!  Some students may find useful to print it out and have it spiral bound. 
        </p>
    
  
    <h3>Code and Regulations</h3>  
      <ul>
        <li>You'll need access to the Code & Regs.  I like <a href="https://shoptax.wolterskluwer.com/en/fed-inc-tx-code-reg-sel-sec-2025ypi.html">CCH, Selected Sections (2024-2025) </a> (paper version)  or <a href="https://www.cchcpelink.com/product/detail/?p=29204">CCH, Selected Sections (2024-2025)</a> (ebook), but the Code & Regs published by West or Foundation are fine. I recommend that you keep it next to you to mark up during class and while doing the problems and readings.  Given the high price of the most current Code & Regs, I would recommend that you purchase one publised last year or even the year before.  Don't worry, an older version will be fine, and the newest verision will be out of date in 6 months.</li>

        <li>Here a pdf of the <a href="IRC_19_20.pdf">CCH '19-'20 Selected Sections</a>.  There haven't been that many changes to the individual income tax provisions since then.</li>
    
        <li>The Code & Regs are available free on line at <a href="https://www.taxnotes.com/research">Tax Materials</a>. This is a fantastic free database of fundamental tax materials, such as the code, regulations, cases and administrative materials. On the Supplemental Materials tab, I show how to make a bookmark that will take you directly to the appropriate code or regulation section. All relevant tax materials are also available on BLaw, WL, Lexis, or VitalLaw.</li>
    
        <li>The required Code & Regs sections that we'll cover for each topic are listed at the beginning of each chapter in Logic Problems. Additional Code & Regs sections are listed separately under the topic headings. </li>
      
        <li>For each topic, first read <em>FIT</em> and then any additional readings and problems.  Unless otherwise noted, we will try to cover all problems in each chapter.  Use the slides to focus on the important materials that we'll cover during the lectures.</li>
      </ul>
      
    <h3>Problem Sets</h3>
   
        <p>For each topic, we'll cover problems that are designed to reinforce the sometimes very difficult materials.   I will assign the problems to particular students.  I highly recommend that you work on the problems in teams.
        </p>

    <h3>Spreadsheet</h3>
    
        <p>Excel,the world's most popular software program, is useful to illustrate and present some of the problems and concepts, for instance, the time value of money.  All students have free access to Excel through Fordham. Basic knowledge of Excel is a fundamental business skill, even for lawyers. I've posted some Excel materials on the <em>Additional Resources</em> page.
        </p>
           

    <h3>Laptops</h3>

      <p>I allow you to use laptops in the classroom, but that doesn't mean you should use them if you are concerned with doing well: <a href="https://goo.gl/XZxnuP">Laptops</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/corpfin20/NoteTaking_Computer_Summary.pdf? ">Laptops2</a>. I suggest that you print out the powerpoint slides and annotate them with your handwritten notes.
      </p>

    <h3>Attendance</h3>
        <p>Attendance is important. An unreasonable number of absences may result in a lower grade.
        </p>

    <h3>Recording</h3>
      <p>For any classes that are recorded this semester, the recordings are the property of the instructor, and students may not download or capture the recordings in any manner, share the recordings, or use them for non-class purposes.
